; Enable apc extension module
extension = apc.so

;  Options for the apc module
;  http://www.php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php
  
;  apc.enabled can be set to 0 to disable APC. This is primarily useful when APC is statically compiled into PHP, 
;  since there is no other way to disable it (when compiled as a DSO, the extension line in php.ini can just be commented-out).
;apc.enabled=1

;  The number of shared memory segments to allocate for the compiler cache. 
;  If APC is running out of shared memory but apc.shm_size is set as high as the system allows, 
;  raising this value might prevent APC from exhausting its memory.
;apc.shm_segments=1

;  The optimization level. Zero disables the optimizer, 
;  and higher values use more aggressive optimizations. 
;  Expect very modest speed improvements. This is experimental.
;apc.optimization=0

;  The size of each shared memory segment in MB. By default, 
;  some systems (including most BSD variants) have very low limits on the size of a shared memory segment.
apc.shm_size=256M

;  The number of seconds a cache entry is allowed to idle in a slot in case this cache entry slot is needed by another entry. 
;  Leaving this at zero means that APC's cache could potentially fill up with stale entries while newer entries won't be cached. 
;  In the event of a cache running out of available memory, the cache will be completely expunged if ttl is equal to 0. Otherwise, 
;  if the ttl is greater than 0, APC will attempt to remove expired entries.
;apc.ttl=0

;  The number of seconds a cache entry is allowed to idle in a slot in case this cache entry slot is needed by another entry. 
;  Leaving this at zero means that APC's cache could potentially fill up with stale entries while newer entries won't be cached. 
;  In the event of a cache running out of available memory, the cache will be completely expunged if ttl is equal to 0. Otherwise, 
;  if the ttl is greater than 0, APC will attempt to remove expired entries.
;apc.user_ttl=0

;  A "hint" about the number of distinct source files that will be included or requested on your web server. 
;  Set to zero or omit if unsure; this setting is mainly useful for sites that have many thousands of source files.
apc.num_files_hint=10000

;  Just like apc.num_files_hint, a "hint" about the number of distinct user cache variables to store. Set to zero or omit if not 
;  sure.
apc.user_entries_hint=10000

;  If compiled with MMAP support by using --enable-mmap this is the mktemp-style file_mask to pass to the mmap module for 
;  determining whether your mmap'ed memory region is going to be file-backed or shared memory backed. 
;  For straight file-backed mmap, set it to something like /tmp/apc.XXXXXX (exactly 6 Xs). 
;  To use POSIX-style shm_open/mmap put a .shm somewhere in your mask. e.g. /apc.shm.XXXXXX You can also set it to /dev/zero 
;  to use your kernel's /dev/zero interface to anonymous mmap'ed memory. Leaving it undefined will force an anonymous mmap.
;apc.mmap_file_mask=/tmp/apc.XXXXXX

;  Mostly for testing and debugging. Setting this enables APC for the CLI version of PHP. Under normal circumstances, 
;  it is not ideal to create, populate and destroy the APC cache on every CLI request, 
;  but for various test scenarios it is useful to be able to enable APC for the CLI version of PHP easily.
apc.enable_cli=1

;  On by default, but can be set to off and used in conjunction with positive apc.filters so that files are 
;  only cached if matched by a positive filter.
;apc.cache_by_default=1


;  Be careful changing this setting. This defaults to on, forcing APC to stat
;  (check) the script on each request to determine if it has been modified. If
;  it has been modified it will recompile and cache the new version. If this
;  setting is off, APC will not check, which usually means that to force APC to
;  recheck files, the web server will have to be restarted or the cache will
;  have to be manually cleared. Note that FastCGI web server configurations may
;  not clear the cache on restart. On a production server where the script files
;  rarely change, a significant performance boost can be achieved by disabled
;  stats.
;  
;  For included/required files this option applies as well, but note that for
;  relative path includes (any path that doesn't start with / on Unix) APC has
;  to check in order to uniquely identify the file. If you use absolute path
;  includes APC can skip the stat and use that absolute path as the unique
;  identifier for the file.
apc.stat=1
